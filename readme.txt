So, I think you installed Compy. It's kind of a Linux terminal, but with some changes. Here's where I got this idea from as of March 30 2025:

In Brazil, in a big city at the south, is a 14yo, and that's me! :D Not long ago, I developed big interest in the Linux kernel. I've always been thinking of making an entire command line. So, I made my own (paper) computer and pretended to type some Linux commands. I included an entire operating system, which I will add later ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So, yesterday, I went home and coded the first command: exit, obviously ._. And then, I went to the site that shows all Linux commands. Go see it for yourself: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/ (i bookmarked it) With the help of ChatGPT, I created an entire command line.

I'm thinking of adding more commands (and probably some easter eggs) later. But that's all there is to say :)  In short, I made Compy for fun. No wait I forgot to say that the name "Compy" comes from Sprunksters, shoutout to the creator of that game :D

Yea that's all there is to say (for real this time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ) I hope you enjoy this command line I made at the age of 14 (which is crazy ngl 0_0), I hope this somehow gets some distros (just like Linux)  and see you in the next update of Compy. Bye!
